# Weather State Transition Analysis

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is an exploratory analysis of weather state transitions using probabilistic models. The notebook contains calculations of prior probabilities of weather states such as sunny, rainy, and foggy, as well as transition probabilities from one state to another.

## Contents
- Definition of prior probabilities of weather states.
- Transition probability matrix outlining the likelihood of moving from today's weather state to tomorrow's.
- Analyses using states (0=sunny, 1=rainy, 2=foggy) to represent different weather conditions.

## Getting Started
To use this notebook:
1. Make sure you have a Jupyter environment set up with Python 3.x.
2. Install any required libraries as specified in the notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells in order to follow the transition probability analysis.

## Prerequisites
- A Jupyter environment (Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook).
- Basic knowledge of probability and Python programming.

## Usage
This notebook is meant for educational purposes, particularly for understanding how to model weather state transitions using probabilities. Follow along the cells to learn about the calculations involved in predicting weather changes.

## Contributing
Contributions to the notebook are welcome. If you have suggestions or improvements, please fork the repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
